# Buying our new car with machine learning

- **The context**: Me and my partner are on the hunt for a new (second hand) car. We know we want a Subaru Outback, have a budget and a range of age and mileage we're happy with.
- **The problem**: Even with our criteria, there are still hundreds of options available. It takes a lot of time to check them all and, with so many moving parts, it is hard to know if a particular car is good value. 
- **The solution**: Spend a couple days scraping data from the internet and building a machine learning model to find the best deals.
